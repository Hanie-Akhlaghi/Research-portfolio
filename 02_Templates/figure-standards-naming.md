# Figure standards + naming convention (template)

## Folder & filenames
- Use: `fig01_topic_condition_metric_v01.png`
- Keep versions: v01, v02... (do not overwrite final)
- Store editable sources in a separate folder (e.g., `source/`)

## Minimum standards
- Axis titles include units
- Consistent decimals across panels
- Use the same font size family across all figures in one paper
- Captions are complete and standalone

## GraphPad/analysis notes
- Record: dataset file name, analysis type, and any exclusions
- Export at high resolution (journal-ready)
