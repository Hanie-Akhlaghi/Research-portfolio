# Statistical Reporting Checklist (template)

## Design & assumptions
- [ ] I clearly stated study design and groups
- [ ] I checked assumptions (normality, homogeneity) or used robust/nonparametric methods
- [ ] I defined primary outcome(s) and timepoints

## Analysis transparency
- [ ] I report exact tests used (e.g., ANOVA + post-hoc; mixed models; Mann–Whitney)
- [ ] I report n per group and how n was determined (if available)
- [ ] I report effect sizes where possible (and CI)
- [ ] I controlled multiple comparisons (if relevant)

## Tables & figures
- [ ] Figure labels include units and group names
- [ ] Captions explain what panels show and summarize the comparison
- [ ] Tables have consistent rounding and p-value format
- [ ] I include data exclusions (counts + reasons)

## Software & reproducibility
- [ ] Software + version noted (SPSS/GraphPad/Minitab)
- [ ] Analysis scripts/steps documented (even if manual clicks)
