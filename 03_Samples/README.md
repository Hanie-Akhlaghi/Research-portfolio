# Samples (add later)

Add 2–3 anonymized samples, for example:
- `sample-figure-pack.pdf` (GraphPad-style figure + caption)
- `sample-results-table.pdf` (clean stats table)
- `prisma-flow.png` (PRISMA 2020 flow diagram based on a dummy review)

Tip: ensure samples contain **no confidential data**.
