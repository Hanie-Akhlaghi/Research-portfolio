# Research Portfolio – Hanie Akhlaghi Monsef

This repository is a curated research portfolio showcasing **how I deliver research outputs** (not just a long list of projects).  
It includes short case studies, reusable templates/checklists, and anonymized sample outputs.

## Tracks
1) **Behavioral neuroscience & rodent models** (protocol execution, behavioral assays, documentation)
2) **Molecular & genetics support** (PCR/qPCR workflows, data organization, interpretation)
3) **Evidence synthesis** (PRISMA-based systematic/scoping reviews; SWiM where applicable)

## Highlights (selected)
- Delivered research support across **preclinical, molecular, and evidence-synthesis projects**.
- Produced **publication-ready figures/tables** and structured analysis reports (SPSS / GraphPad Prism / Minitab).
- Built and QC’d **PRISMA workflows**: screening strategy, extraction templates, synthesis and reporting.
- Mentored and supervised students/junior staff on **protocols, documentation standards, and ethics/compliance**.
- Supported 130+ completed projects and 15+ submissions (7 accepted/in press) across biomedical and neuroscience topics.
- Delivered publication-ready tables/figures and structured analysis reports using IBM SPSS, Minitab, and GraphPad Prism.
- Supported PRISMA-based evidence synthesis: systematic/scoping reviews and SWiM where meta-analysis was not feasible.
- Animal lab delivery: surgeries/sampling + behavioral assays; trained/supervised 300+ students/junior staff; contributed to 200+ deliverables.
- Serve as an ad-hoc peer reviewer for PLOS ONE (methodology/statistics, evidence synthesis).
- Thesis deliverables: 29 graphs + 13 results tables + 8 finalized figures (CUMS + qPCR project).
