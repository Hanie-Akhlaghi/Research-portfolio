CASE STUDY #01 — CUMS + Probiotic (E. coli Nissle 1917) in Wistar Rats (Thesis Project Delivery)

## Context / Goal
- Master’s thesis on the gut–brain axis: evaluating the effects of CUMS and a probiotic (E. coli Nissle 1917) on memory/pain-related behavior and hippocampal plasticity in male Wistar rats. 

## My Role
- Study execution support (animal handling + behavioral testing), molecular workflow support (qPCR), data interpretation, analysis and thesis-ready reporting.

## Methods & Tools
- Experimental/Assays: [CUMS / sampling / behavioral tests / PCR/qPCR / ...]
- Data/Analysis: [SPSS / GraphPad Prism / correlation], QC steps, reproducible reporting
- Design: 64 animals, 2 durations (2 & 3 weeks), 4 groups (control, stress, probiotic, probiotic+stress).
- Behavioral tests: Morris water maze, locomotion, rotarod, hot plate.
- Molecular: hippocampal bdnf and grin2b gene expression using Real-Time PCR (qPCR). 

## Deliverables
- 29 charts/graphs + 13 results tables + 8 finalized figures (paper/thesis-ready), with captions and consistent formatting
- Analysis package (cleaned dataset + statistical outputs) + thesis/manuscript-ready Methods/Results write-up + QC notes (variable definitions, exclusions if any)

## Impact / Metrics (use numbers)
- Scale: 64 animals, 4 groups (control, stress, probiotic, stress+treatment), 2 exposure windows (2 & 3 weeks); behavioral battery + hippocampal qPCR (BDNF, GRIN2B)
- Output volume: 29 graphs + 13 tables + 8 final figures delivered as a coherent reporting pack
- Quality: publication-ready formatting (units, group labels, consistent styles) → fewer revision cycles and faster integration into thesis/manuscript
- Status: Master’s thesis completed; manuscript draft prepared

## Notes on Ethics / Confidentiality
- All portfolio samples shared publicly are anonymized/reconstructed; no personal identifiers, institution names, or raw identifiable records are included.
- Work followed lab SOPs and institutional ethics requirements; sensitive details are omitted from the public portfolio.
