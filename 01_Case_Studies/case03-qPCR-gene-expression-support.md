CASE STUDY #03 — qPCR / Gene Expression Workflow Support (Primer/Assay + Reporting)

## Context / Goal
- Standardized qPCR workflow support to ensure assay quality, QC transparency, and thesis/manuscript-ready reporting.

## My Role
- qPCR support: workflow setup, QC review (amplification/melt curves), data organization, and reporting outputs.

## Methods & Tools
- Real-time PCR (qPCR): assay QC, melt curve specificity checks, standard curve interpretation
- Documentation: sample tracking + batch QC notes
- Reporting: figure/table outputs for thesis/manuscript inclusion

## Deliverables
- QC-ready figure set (amplification/melt curves, standard curves)
- Clean result tables + export-ready plots
- Short method notes / documentation pack

## Impact / Metrics (use numbers)
- Reduced ambiguity in reporting by providing QC evidence alongside results
- Enabled faster supervisor review by packaging outputs as “ready-to-insert” figures/tables

## Notes on Ethics / Confidentiality
- No sample identifiers or institution names are included in public materials.
