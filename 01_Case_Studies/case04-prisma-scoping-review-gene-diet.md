CASE STUDY #04 — PRISMA Scoping/Systematic Review (Gene–Diet Interactions)

## Context / Goal
- PRISMA-based evidence synthesis with a transparent screening/extraction workflow and structured reporting (SWiM where meta-analysis was not feasible).

## My Role
- Built/managed the screening pipeline, Analysis, extraction structure, synthesis reporting, and quality control of counts/reasons.

## Methods & Tools
- PRISMA workflow: deduplication, title/abstract screening, full-text eligibility, reason tracking
- Extraction templates + reporting checklists
- synthesis outputs (tables/figures), SWiM narrative synthesis as applicable

## Deliverables
- PRISMA flow diagram + screening log structure
- Extraction template + synthesis tables (anonymized outputs)

## Impact / Metrics (use numbers)
- Records identified: 1,999
- Duplicates removed: 1,024; other removals (prescreen): 725
- Records screened: 250; excluded: 193
- Full-text sought/assessed: 57; included: 9 reports (8 unique cohorts)
- Full-text exclusions: 48 (with documented reasons)

## Notes on Ethics / Confidentiality
- Public materials contain only aggregate counts and anonymized examples.
